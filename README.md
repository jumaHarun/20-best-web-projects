## List of projects 

### Google Homepage

#### 🎯 Project Goals: 

Create a replica of the google homepage. No need to add functionality yet. Just try to emulate the layout as best as possible. You can check out this Scrimba lesson for a walkthrough for a bit more of a guide.

#### 📝 What will you learn? 

Basic CSS, cloning a layout

#### 🏋🏻 Stretch Goals: 
Try creating a mockup of the search results page or cloning a more complicated homepage (I suggest Yelp).
